            <h3>Doctor Who is a beloved show with a long, expansive and, frankly, absurd history. Its full of inside-jokes, references and a TARDIS-full of expanded media, spanning books, audio dramas, movies, spin-off shows, animated series, podcasts, Web shorts, comic-books and, somehow, even more. This kind of backlog is both an enticing thing for someone looking for a fun new fiction to dive into, but can often feel like staring into the Time Vortex, unsure where to begin or know what's essential. 
            <br />
            <br />
            That's why I made the Doctor Who Regenerator. To hopefully make the show a bit less Wibbly-Wobbly to get into, and start you on the right path for watching the show.
